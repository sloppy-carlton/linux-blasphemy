# Xfce4 Windows 95 Anti-Rice
> [!NOTE]
> This is a very rough draft of what will eventually be instructions on how to rice your desktop to get it to look as close to Windows 95 as possible. It is still very much a work in progress that I can only pursue in my limited free time, so please be patient.

### Step 2: Theming LightDM
So far, we've themed Xfce to look as much like Windows 95 as possible. Now we're going to do the same with LightDM, so that we can get the login screen for Windows 95. This is not going to be as straightforward as installing a GTK+, icon, and/or cursor theme. You're going to need to edit config files, so be careful.

You'll need to clone the Chicago95 repo I linked in the last step:
```
git clone https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95.git
```

If you follow [these instructions](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/tree/master/Lightdm/Chicago95), you shouldn't have a problem.
